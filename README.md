# Motion-Sensors
This is a project that implements two motions sensors in Android, Gyroscope and Accelerometer.
The project uses the values of the accelerometer in order to move a red Ball all over the visible area of the device, and prints the values given by the Gyroscope in order to recognize the changes if you move the device from one side to the other.
You are encouraged to test it at a physical device, since it has hardware sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope that can be better at a physical device. Feel free to use the code and implement it for educational purposes.
Made in Android Studio, Layout may vary from device to device, but it can be changed, for example:

- The size of the text drawn -> paint.setTextSize();
- Or the radius of the circle.
